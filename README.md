*"The Last Of At" - A Fanfictional Tribute Survival Roguelike in 1K of JS
By [KesieV](http://www.kesiev.com) (c) 2014*


A mysterious mushroom infected humanity and is turning it in a deadly horde
of zombies!
But there's still hope: with the right amount of mushroom roots, extracted
from a certain type of zombie, a vaccine can be synthetized!
With the help of Dollie, your surprisingly zombie-immune young partner,
you'll start your deadly journey in the ultimate attempt to save humanity!

Move Joet `@` with arrows. Dollie `$`, your partner, will follow you. Avoid
or kill weak `1-2`, medium `3-4`) or strong zombies `5-6-7-8-9` and reach
the next zone `^`.
Collect bandages `+` to gain HP, knives `/` to kill strong zombies in one hit
and vials `U` to increase your score.

Your mission is to collect mushroom root vials you can obtain cutting them
from strong zombies only.
You've to hunt them so explore each zone, look for an exit to the next one
and try to not get killed.
You can damage zombies hitting them, dealing 1 damage point. When a zombie
reaches 0 it will die. Zombies killed with standard attacks could drop a
bandage or a knife.

The knife kills strong zombies in one hit: a strong zombie always drops
something, such as another knife, a bandage or a mushroom root vial.
Collect them! Humanity depends on you!

Zombies can attack you too and they will deal as much damage as their size so
face zombies carefully. Strong and medium zombies are blind and they will
move randomly but weak zombies are able to hear you!
You won't be alone: Dollie will follow you, covering your back since she's
immune of zombies but keep in mind that you can't displace her - especially
in narrow corridors!

Good luck!
